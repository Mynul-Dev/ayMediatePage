          Dr Bharat Thakur is first a foremost a researcher, an explorer and a
          knower. He has a direct and practical approach to meditation and
          spirituality. He offers guiding principles and methodologies rather
          than hard coded concepts or philosophies. For him, processes are of
          primary importance, not ideologies and beliefs. In these weekly
          sessions, he presents to us innumerable ways to meditate. Using
          techniques from Kriya Yoga, Naad Yoga, Swar Yoga, Buddhist Chanting,
          Bhairav Dhyan, Unique Breathwork and Guided Meditations he opens your
          mind to an array of different methods that can free up the tangled
          space of the mind. These tangles or knots are known as granthis in
          yogic parlance. These granthis obstruct our energy flows causing them
          to be blocked. We see the manifestation of these blocks in the form of
          disease, which can be Physical, Mental or Emotional. The strength of
          Dr. Bharat Thakurâ€™s methods is that they are simple, profound and
          effective and yet they have their roots in the ancient philosophy that
          he is a master
